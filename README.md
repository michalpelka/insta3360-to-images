# insta360-to-images

A C++17 rewrite of [InstaToBag](https://github.com/michalpelka/InstaToBag) that
converts an Insta360 `.insv` capture into **per-camera folders of timestamped JPEG
frames** instead of a ROS 2 MCAP bag: both fisheye tracks, each frame named by its
nanosecond timestamp on the camera's own clock, plus an optional 1 kHz IMU CSV,
per-lens intrinsics sidecar, the camera's own stitched equirectangular preview, and
a real per-frame geometric equirectangular stitch computed from the camera's own
lens calibration -- see [Equirect video](#equirect) below. Uses OpenCV for
exactly two things: decoding the firmware preview's pixel format, and the stitch's
projection/blending math.

Developed and verified against an **Insta360 X5** (firmware `v1.10.11_build1`, 5.7K
dual-fisheye, 2880x2880 per lens at 24 fps). The trailer format is shared across the
X-series, so ONE X2/X3/X4 files should work; the parsers degrade to "field not
present" rather than to wrong values when a firmware revision differs.

## Build

Requires a C++17 compiler, CMake >= 3.16, OpenCV (`core`, `imgproc`, `imgcodecs` --
e.g. `brew install opencv` or `apt install libopencv-dev`), and `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` on
`PATH` at *runtime* (not needed to build):

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

This produces `build/insta360-to-images` and, unless you pass
`-DINSTA360_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`, a unit test binary run via `ctest`:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Use

```bash
# See what's in a file without writing anything
insta360-to-images VID_20260909_132827_00_005.insv --inspect

# Convert (writes VID_20260909_132827_00_005/ beside the input)
insta360-to-images VID_20260909_132827_00_005.insv

# A quick look at a long clip, at a quarter resolution
insta360-to-images capture.insv -o small/ --max-frames 100 --scale 0.25
```

Run `insta360-to-images --help` for the full set. The useful ones:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--jpeg-quality N` | ffmpeg MJPEG quality, 2 (best) to 31. Default 3. |
| `--scale SPEC` | `0.5` or `1440x1440`. Intrinsics are rescaled to match. |
| `--max-frames N` | Stop after N frames. |
| `--swap-lenses` | Map the second video track to `cam_front`. |
| `--no-imu` / `--no-camera-info` / `--no-panorama` | Leave out `imu.csv` / the intrinsics sidecar / `panorama.jpg`. |
| `--no-equirect` | Skip stitching the geometric per-frame equirect video (on by default, compute-heavy). |
| `--equirect-width N` | Equirect output width; height is always `N/2`. Default 3840. |
| `--no-equirect-flip` | Don't rotate the equirect output 180 degrees; row 0 becomes the north pole instead of the south pole. The flip is on by default and, when applied, is a full rotation, not a mirror flip -- see below. |
| `--relative-time` | Start timestamps at zero instead of the capture wall clock. |
| `-f`, `--force` | Write into a non-empty output directory. |

## Output layout

```
<output>/
  cam_front/
    camera_info.json        # once, if lens calibration was present
    1736432112123456789.jpg # one per frame, named by its epoch nanosecond timestamp
    1736432112165123456.jpg
    ...
  cam_back/
    camera_info.json
    <timestamp_ns>.jpg
    ...
  imu.csv                   # timestamp_ns,accel_x_mps2,...,gyro_z_radps at ~1 kHz
  panorama.jpg              # the camera's own firmware-stitched equirect preview
  equirect/                 # unless --no-equirect
    <timestamp_ns>.jpg      # one geometrically stitched equirect frame per video frame
```

With `--relative-time`, filenames and `imu.csv` timestamps count nanoseconds from the
start of the clip instead of epoch nanoseconds.

### `panorama.jpg`

This one is **not** a panorama this tool computes. The trailer already carries a
low-resolution (typically 1280x640) equirectangular thumbnail that the camera's own
firmware stitched from both lenses at capture time (trailer record `0x0002`); this
tool just decodes its NV12 pixel format via `cv::cvtColor` and writes it out as a
JPEG via `cv::imwrite`.

### `equirect/`

By default this tool computes a real per-frame geometric equirectangular stitch, at
`--equirect-width` resolution (default 3840x1920), one JPEG per video frame, named
the same way as `cam_front`/`cam_back`; pass `--no-equirect` to skip it (it's
compute-heavy). Row 0 is the south pole by default (the 180-degree flip, see below,
is applied unless you pass `--no-equirect-flip`); pass `--no-equirect-flip` if your
consumer expects row 0 at the north pole (straight up) instead. The flip does a full
180-degree rotation (`cv::ROTATE_180`), not a single-axis flip: negating only
latitude (or only longitude) is a mirror reflection that reverses the scene's
handedness -- panning left vs. right would feel backwards in a viewer. Rotating both
axes swaps the pole correctly; the resulting longitude shift is invisible since the
image wraps.

Getting here took ruling out the obvious approach first: the embedded `offset_v2`
lens calibration's `fx`/`fy`/`cx`/`cy` plus five distortion coefficients do not fit
any *documented* fisheye model closely enough to project with -- plugging its numbers
into the equidistant, equisolid, stereographic, or a normalized-domain polynomial
model all give a field of view around 35-40 degrees for a lens that visibly covers
most of a hemisphere. The actual model turned out to be the **Mei/Barreto unified
spherical camera model** (project onto a unit sphere, offset by a mirror parameter
`xi`, then perspective-project, then apply ordinary radial + tangential distortion on
that plane) with `xi = 2.0` for both lenses on an X5 -- confirmed by cross-referencing
an independent reverse-engineering effort
([BenjaminHenriksson/insv-stitch](https://github.com/BenjaminHenriksson/insv-stitch))
that landed on the same model and field layout from different footage, and validated
here end-to-end against a real capture (see `equirect.hpp`/`equirect.cpp` for the
exact math and how the rotation convention was pinned down empirically).

What this does *not* do, matching the state of that reference implementation:
IMU-based stabilization or horizon-locking, rolling-shutter correction, or
per-channel chromatic-aberration correction. Concretely, that means the output
faithfully reproduces whatever roll/tilt the physical camera had at each instant --
a handheld clip's equirect video will visibly tilt as the camera does, exactly like
the raw fisheye footage does. Leveling that requires fusing the IMU stream (already
exported as `imu.csv`) into a per-frame stabilization rotation, which is future work.
The seam blend is a plain linear feather by view angle (weight 1 within 83 degrees of
a lens' own axis, fading to 0 by 97 degrees), which close-up testing against this
same reference showed performs as well as optical-flow-based blending for this
camera's ~3cm lens baseline -- distant structure aligns well; close objects (a hand
near the lens) show the parallax ghosting inherent to any dual-fisheye rig at that
range, not fixable by geometry alone.

This is compute-heavier than the rest of the tool: building the per-lens remap
tables is a one-time cost per run, but every frame still does two `cv::remap` calls
plus a per-pixel blend at the target resolution. Expect roughly the same order of
magnitude as decoding the source HEVC.

### `camera_info.json`

One per camera, written once, holding the same intrinsics the original tool put on
`sensor_msgs/CameraInfo` (`fx`/`fy`/`cx`/`cy`, the 3x3 `k`, 3x3 `r` -- identity, since
no stereo rectification is defined for a back-to-back fisheye pair -- and the 3x4
`p`), plus the fields a plain `CameraInfo` message has no room for: `xi` (the Mei
model's mirror parameter) and `distortion` (`k1`, `k2`, `k3`, `p1`, `p2`, under
`distortion_model: "insta360_mei_v2"`), and the per-lens `rotation_deg`/`translation`
the camera reports (not a calibrated IMU-to-camera extrinsic). Note `k`/`p` are the
ordinary pinhole matrices built from `fx`/`fy`/`cx`/`cy` alone -- they do *not*
capture `xi` or the distortion, so they're only a rough pinhole approximation near
the lens center, not something to feed `cv::undistort`. The `equirect/` output (see
below) is where the full model is actually used; `--equirect` is the thing to reach
for if you want the geometry right, not this file.

## Caveats — read before you use the data

Carried over unchanged from the original tool; nothing about the trailer format or
its ambiguities changed in this rewrite.

- **IMU axes are the sensor's own, not REP 103.** Accelerometer and gyroscope are
  converted to m/s² and rad/s, but they are *not* rotated into ROS's x-forward /
  y-left / z-up convention, because the mapping from the X-series sensor frame to the
  camera body frame is undocumented. Determine it for your rig before fusing.
- **No IMU-to-camera extrinsics.** The metadata carries per-lens rotations, but not a
  calibrated IMU-to-camera transform. The per-lens rotation and translation values are
  passed through verbatim in `camera_info.json`.
- **`camera_info.json`'s `k`/`p` are plain pinhole, not the real lens model.**
  `distortion_model` is `insta360_mei_v2` (Mei/Barreto unified spherical model, `xi`
  plus radial/tangential terms -- see [Equirect video](#equirect)), which is
  what `--equirect` actually uses. `k`/`p` in that same file are ordinary pinhole
  matrices built from `fx`/`fy`/`cx`/`cy` alone and must not be fed to
  `cv::undistort`/`cv::fisheye` as if they captured the real distortion -- they don't.
- **`cam_front` / `cam_back` is naming, not a determination.** They follow the order
  of the video tracks in the file, which is stable but has not been confirmed against
  which lens physically faces the screen. Use `--swap-lenses` if you need them the
  other way round.
- **JPEG re-encode is lossy.** Frames are decoded from HEVC and re-encoded as JPEG.
  Lower `--jpeg-quality` for more fidelity, or keep the original file for archival.
- **IMU covariances are unknown** and are simply not written; treat `imu.csv` as raw
  sensor readings, not a calibrated `sensor_msgs/Imu`-equivalent.
- **`--equirect` has no horizon leveling.** Without IMU-based stabilization, the
  output tilts and rolls exactly as the physical camera did at each instant -- see
  [Equirect video](#equirect).

## The `.insv` format

Unchanged from the original project; see its
[README](https://github.com/michalpelka/InstaToBag#the-insv-format) for the full
trailer layout, timestamp derivation, and how the IMU axis/scale assignment was
physically validated. This rewrite reads the identical byte layout.
